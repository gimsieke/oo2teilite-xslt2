oo2teilite-xslt2
================

OpenDocument Writer to TEI lite P5 converter, written in XSLT 2.0

Works with OpenOffice 3.2 and newer.


* This package contains:

  - oo-identity.xsl     exports the internal .odt document representation
  - oo2teilite.xsl      the actual TEI export filter
  - oo2teilite.jar      XML export filter package, to be installed in 
                        "Tools > XML Filter Settings..."
  - beispiele.odt       sample OpenDocument 1.2 file, illustrating some
                        of the export filter's features.

  You may use oo-identity.xsl for debugging purposes. The XML that is
  exported by this stylesheet looks exactly as OOo sees the data when 
  applying a stylesheet. You can run saxon on this export on the command
  line, which will make debugging easier.

  A sample invocation looks like:
  saxon -xsl:oo2teilite.xsl -s:mydoc.ooo.xml -o:mydoc.tei.xml debug=yes

  When the parameter debug is at any value, several debug files (pattern:
  debug.00.pass.xml) will be created where the consecutive conversion 
  stages may be tracked.


* Features:

  - nested <div>s, either (if present) via h/@outline-level or via named 
    paragraph styles ('Heading 1', 'Heading 2', ... -- configurable)
  
  - nested text formatting, e.g.: 
      bold
      /bold
      bold+italic
      /bold+italic
      bold+italic+wide
      /bold+italic+wide
      bold+italic
      /bold+italic
      bold
      /bold
    =>
      bold
        italic
          wide
          /wide
        /italic
      /bold
  
  - tables
  
  - footnotes
  
  - sequential numbering ("Randnummern") of content-carrying elements via xml:id
  
  - track changes (the final version will be exported)

  - comments

* Missing features:

  - image support
  
  - better table support   

  - many more 
  

* Bugs:

  - track changes doesn't work correctly (see the corresponding comments
    in beispiele.odt, or run the export filter on that file if you don't
    speak German)

  - this is work in progress, don't expect everything to run smoothly

  - text style resolution doesn't look for default styles or for text styles
    of the containig paragraph. This may lead to redundant <hi> tags for 
    default formatting, such as <p><hi rend="style-normal">...
